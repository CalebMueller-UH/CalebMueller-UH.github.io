summary: "Automated project setup tool for creating a local project Git repository containing template files and connecting it to remote repository on GitHub."
---
This script is a tool that streamlines the process of starting a new projectfor ICS314. The script automates the creation of a local Git repository and sets up a remote repository on GitHub, as well as adding template files, setting up npm tools, and creating an initial commit. This saves time and effort compared to manually performing these steps every time a new project is started.


## Functionality
The script performs several key functions:
- Checks if the user is logged into GitHub and installs the gh command if necessary
- Initializes a local Git repository with the specified name
- Connects the local repository to a remote repository on GitHub (either an existing repository or a new repository created by the script)
- Adds template files to the local repository
- Sets up npm tools
- Creates an initial commit in the local repository

## Usage
To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:
bash:
```
./init_idea_proj.sh <destination_directory> [repo_link_or_description]
```

The destination_directory argument is the name of the local repository that will be created.

The optional repo_link_or_description argument can either be a remote repository link ending in ".git" or a description of the project. If a repository link is provided, the script will connect the local repository to the remote repository. If a description is provided, the script will create a new remote repository on GitHub with the given description.

## Limitations and Assumptions
- The script assumes that the gh command is installed and that the user is logged into GitHub.
- The script will overwrite any existing directory with the same name as the destination_directory.
- The script assumes that the project_initializer.config file and template_files directory are located in the proj_init_dir directory.

## Conclusion
The Project Initializer script is a useful tool for streamlining the process of starting a new project in the ICS314 class. By automating several key steps, the script saves time and effort compared to manually performing these steps every time a new project is started. This project showcases my ability to write complex bash scripts and demonstrates my understanding of Git and npm tools.
