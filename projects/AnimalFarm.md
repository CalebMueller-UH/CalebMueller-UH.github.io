This project was the bulk of a C & C++ course taken in my Junior year of the Computer Engineering program at University of Hawaii at Manoa.  It features several stages all focused on different ways in which to implement a database including arrays and singly-linked lists.  I learned a great deal about programming in this project, and feel like it marked a period of growth for me as a developer.  Going into this class I already had a few years of C++ programming knowledge, but still learned so much more about the supporting ecosystems which make contemporary development possible; technologies such as cmake, version control, and the writing of unit tests.

As I gain more projects I will be sure to update the page to include examples of my growing skillset, but this project is special to me, and I feel as though it earns a place within my portfolio for that reason.
