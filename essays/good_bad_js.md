JavaScript (JS) is a popular programming language utilized in a variety of software development fields, including web, desktop, mobile, server-side, and IoT applications.  As a beginner in programming, my introduction to JavaScript has been positive.  Before taking a software engineering course focusing on JavaScript, I had limited exposure to the language through my work with NodeRed.  I found the syntax similar to C and C++, making it easy for me to grasp the basics quickly.  However, JavaScript is unique as it is a dynamic and weakly typed language, offering more flexibility in dealing with various data types without the need for overloading.  Additionally, functions in JavaScript are considered first-class objects, meaning they can possess properties and methods and be treated like any other object.

This essay will highlight my thoughts on JavaScript, including its strengths and limitations.  Despite the many benefits of using JavaScript, it is important to acknowledge some of the challenges that come with it.  I will also share my personal experience with athletic software engineering and the practice of daily coding, known as WODs.

### Strengths of JavaScript
JavaScript is a widely-used programming language with many strengths, making it a popular choice for web application development.  It is easy to understand, versatile, and supported by most modern web browsers.  This makes it an accessible language for beginners, with a large and supportive community.

One of the key benefits of JavaScript is its integration with other languages and tools and the many libraries available to support specific applications.  For instance, if strict type-checking is required, TypeScript can be used, which is similar to JavaScript but with added typing.  This versatility and ease of use have led to widespread adoption, with ample job opportunities available at companies such as Google and Meta.

### JavaScript Pitfalls
While JavaScript is a user-friendly language, there may be better choices for some use cases.  For example, its Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and garbage collection can result in added overhead, making it less suitable for resource-constrained devices such as those in an IoT infrastructure's edge.  However, tools like WebAssembly can help optimize JS performance on such devices.

Another limitation of JavaScript is security.  The code used within a web application is visible to users, which can increase the risk of attacks such as cross-site scripting, session data exposure, unintended script execution, and JavaScript injection.  However, these risks can be mitigated by following best practices in web development and using security libraries and frameworks.

## JavaScript's Utility Going into the Future
Despite some limitations, JavaScript remains a growing technology with many benefits.  It is widely used and constantly evolving, with new functionality such as the recently adopted ES6 standard, which includes features like arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring that enhance code readability and efficiency.  This shows that JavaScript is thriving and will likely maintain its prominence in the future.

Additionally, technologies such as Node.js and React have expanded the capabilities and reach of JavaScript, allowing for both front-end and back-end development and creating rich and interactive user interfaces.  These factors make JavaScript a valuable tool for software development and a language worth considering for any project.

## The Value of "WODs"
I am currently taking the ICS 314 class, which emphasizes the concept of "Athletic Software Engineering" through daily practice problems called "Workouts-Of-The-Day" (WODs).  Thankfully this type of WOD doesn't involve burpees but rather is designed to improve fluency and skill in software development through frequent practice and increasing difficulty.  This approach is more effective in acquiring and developing talent than the passive absorption of information so common in academic settings.

The WODs can be challenging, but the process is manageable and enjoyable with the proper level of difficulty.  The WODs aim to provide an active and engaging learning experience, similar to athletic training, to improve software engineering skills rapidly.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, JavaScript is a widely-used and powerful language that has become an essential part of modern software development.  Its strengths include its ease of use, versatility, broad support, and a large community of developers.  However, performance and security concerns are limitations that must be considered.  Despite these limitations, the constant evolution of the language and the development of new technologies make it clear that JavaScript will continue to play a crucial role in software development in the future.  Additionally, daily coding through WODs can provide valuable opportunities to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

Overall, JavaScript offers many opportunities for developers, and with the right approach and tools, it can be used to create robust and efficient applications.  Whether for web, desktop, mobile, server-side, or IoT applications, JavaScript is a language worth exploring for anyone interested in software development.
