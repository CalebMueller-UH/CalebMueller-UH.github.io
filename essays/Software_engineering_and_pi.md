## Software Engineering and ùùÖ
Socrates said, "The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."  As a junior engineer who is only now beginning their journey through what I hope is a successful career, I am humbled by my limited knowledge.  The wide range of capacities and skill sets found throughout engineering are as diverse as the depth of knowledge from which they draw their insights.  My learning journey has expanded a previously narrow definition of what I considered to be software engineering.


## Like an Onion: Its got Layers
The discipline of being a "Professional Software Engineer" encompasses more than merely having proficiency in a particular programming language.  Although strong coding skills are undeniably a component, software engineering also involves the myriad other tasks and details that make a project come together. Any endeavor that is to bear the brunt of its own complexity requires a level of proportional forethought.  Software engineering is fundamentally a recursive process of problem solving on various levels of complexity -- where a bigger problem is continuously broken down into smaller achievable steps.

## Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
When multiple people are involved in writing code for the same project the need for close coordination quickly becomes apparent.  Developers need to be on the same page about what packages are being used, which coding standards to follow, or who is responsible for what.  Ensuring that everyone's contributions work in the same development environment directly impacts the overall success of the project.  The whole benefit of working on a team is to reduce the bigger problem into smaller parts that can be worked on in parallel, but to do this requires careful coordination. 


Agile is one of many commonly used approaches to managing a project, and is better suited for smaller to medium-sized teams.  It emphasizes collaboration, iterative development, and continually delivering updates in small increments. Issue-driven development is a complementary practice that promotes objective oriented development which prioritizes resolving issues or bugs.  Used alongside agile methodologies, the combination has proven to be an effective method for breaking a project down by phase and collaborating on the needed tasks as a team to get it done.

## Infinitesimal through to the infinite and back again

As I progress in my journey as a software engineer, I think it's crucial to remember the far-reaching implications ones work can have for all who interact with products we create. The adage 'With great power comes great responsibility' is not simply a cliche, but a rallying call for professionalism. Those who have had a role in my education have made a concerted effort to instill a sense of duty and responsibility as an engineer beginning his career.
