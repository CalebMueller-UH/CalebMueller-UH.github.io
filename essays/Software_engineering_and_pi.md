## Software Engineering and ùùÖ
Socrates said, "The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing."  As a junior engineer who is only now beginning their journey through what I hope is a successful career, I am humbled by my limited knowledge.  The wide range of capacities and skill sets found throughout engineering are as diverse as the depth of knowledge from which they draw their insights.  My learning journey, thus far, can be characterized as a continuous expansion of awareness regarding scale. In other words, as I grasp more of the pieces and how they interconnect, my previous narrow definition of what I considered software engineering has broadened into a deeper understanding.

## It's got layers like an onion
The discipline of being a "Professional Software Engineer" encompasses more than merely having proficiency in a particular programming language.  Although strong coding skills are undeniably essential, software engineering involves creating and managing all the pieces that contribute to a high-quality product. Laying the groundwork for any design that will bear the brunt of its complexity requires forethought and planning.

## Working with others
At a higher level of consideration are the decisions that involve others you're working with. For example, how will you manage the configuration of your development environments to realize your design? Everyone must be on the same page about what packages are being used, which coding standards to follow, or who is responsible for what.  The power of a team is that big problems become smaller problems that can be solved in parallel.

Ensuring everyone is on the same page is a big deal when working with technology.  There are so many details to manage, that it's useful to manage these tasks in some sort of structure.  Agile project management is a proven approach for smaller to medium-sized teams, emphasizing collaboration, iterative development, and delivering value in small increments. Issue-driven development is a complementary approach that prioritizes resolving issues or bugs, making it a practical tactic to use alongside agile methodologies.

## Infintesimal continuity through to the infinite
Broader still in the scope of what it means to be a professional software engineer resides the understanding of our work's impact on the world. As engineers, we wield unprecedented power to shape our surroundings. Therefore, we must treat the adage "with great power comes great responsibility" as a meaningful reminder rather than a trite clich√©.
