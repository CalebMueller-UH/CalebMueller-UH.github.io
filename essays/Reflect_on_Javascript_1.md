Javascript is a widely-used programming language in the field of web development. As a new programmer, my initial experience with Javascript has been positive. Not only is it relatively easy to understand, but it also boasts versatility and practicality in a variety of applications. This essay aims to express my thoughts on Javascript thus far, including its strengths and limitations, as well as my personal experience with athletic software engineering and the practice of daily coding referred to as "WODs."

One of the main reasons why I believe Javascript to be a valuable language to learn is its widespread use. It is one of the most commonly used programming languages worldwide, and is used in the creation of a diverse array of applications, from basic websites to complex web-based systems. This means that as a Javascript developer, there will be many job opportunities available. Furthermore, Javascript's syntax is relatively uncomplicated, and it boasts a large, supportive community, making it an approachable language for beginners.

Another aspect that makes Javascript an attractive language to learn is its ubiquity. With the rise of the internet and the web, Javascript has become an essential language for web development. It is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages, and is supported by all major web browsers. This means that as a Javascript developer, you will have the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and applications, both for the web and beyond.

What I also find appealing about the language is that it is still a growing and evolving technology. The added functionality provided by the ES6 standard is evidence of the ongoing development of the language, and I've found that this recent addition has been extremely beneficial. Unlike some languages where new additions have overcomplicated the syntax, ES6 introduced various new features and improvements to the language, including arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring, among others. These features have made the development process more efficient, and have also made the code more readable and maintainable.

As someone who has prior experience with C++, I have found that the similarity between Javascript and C++ has made the transition to Javascript easier. Both languages are object-oriented and have similar syntax, which has made it easier for me to understand and work with Javascript. This has been a valuable advantage in my learning journey, as I was able to apply my prior knowledge to a new language.

From a software engineering perspective, I believe Javascript to be a great programming language. One of the main reasons is its dynamic and versatile nature, which allows for a wide range of applications. Additionally, the language is well-suited to object-oriented programming, which is a key paradigm in software engineering.

I have found the daily coding practice "WODs" to be a useful tool in developing my competency in programming. The WODs are short coding challenges that test and improve one's skills. Through regular completion of WODs, I have been able to identify areas for improvement and focus on them in my studies. Frequent practice and active engagement is more beneficial than passive absorption of information. The WODs can be challenging but manageable and enjoyable, providing a sense of accomplishment and progress in my development as a programmer.

In conclusion, Javascript has proven to be a valuable language to learn for beginners in the field of programming. Its widespread use, ease of learning, and added functionality provided by ES6 are all noteworthy advantages. Furthermore, daily coding practices such as WODs have been a useful tool in developing competency in programming. The learning style of frequent practice and active engagement has been more beneficial than passive absorption of information. While this class may prove challenging, I am optimistic about my ability to work through the challenges and make the most of this learning experience. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer, and I look forward to seeing where my knowledge of Javascript will take me in the future.
