Anthropology has shown that when cultures can communicate and exchange ideas, it leads to the flow of knowledge and innovation.  This point has been demonstrated throughout history, from the use of Latin in the Western world during the medieval period to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics through the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.  In much the same way, adopting coding standards in software engineering plays a crucial role in promoting the flow of knowledge and innovation within an organization.

Just as the Rosetta Stone allowed for the translation of ancient Egyptian knowledge into a more widely understood language, coding standards provide a common language for software developers to collaborate and exchange ideas.  By establishing a uniform set of conventions and guidelines for writing code, developers can integrate and build upon each other's work more efficiently, leading to the developing of new and innovative solutions.

In any collaborative environment, the existence of some standard operating procedure (SOP) allows the team to focus more on the work rather than on adjusting to each other's style.  Everyone working from a uniform foundation reduces the guesswork and mental overhead of continually interpreting the irregularities between multiple contributors' work.  

I agree with the notion of standardization being necessary.   My experience in the military was that much of the interoperability and efficiency found throughout the army was due to a focused emphasis on adhering to "the standard".  Because everyone was operating on the same foundational set of SOPs, it was feasible to take, for example, a machine gunner from one unit, and he would be just as effective in another without the need for a large amount of retraining.  Likewise, standardization plays a massive role in how professional organizations effectively work as a team; without it, they'd be lost.

Ultimately there needs to be some protocol to ensure that the overall quality of deliverables is cohesive, consistent, readable, and maintainable.  Developing a complex system with many moving parts, where an entire team of software developers is contributing code to that project, would be a nightmare without some ground rules.  Coding standards lay out the structure and style of code and exist to improve the readability and maintainability of code written by many developers contributing to the same project's codebase.  Adhering to an agreed-upon standard makes the project's code more uniformly predictable and consistent, resulting in more readable, maintainable, scalable, and robust code.

When everyone is on the same coding standard page, there's less ambiguity about what "right" looks like.  This uniformity makes finding and fixing bugs easier, particularly when looking at someone else's code, because there is less style variation; you know what to expect.  Added to this are the benefits of preventing bugs and vulnerabilities before they even arise by adhering to a given standard's best practices.  Additionally, having a standardized coding approach also improves the scalability of a team.  When new members are onboarded, they can quickly learn the existing coding practices and start contributing to the project with minimal ramp-up time.  This reduces the time and effort required to bring new team members up to speed and allows the team to scale more efficiently.

Moreover, coding standards also ensure that code is written consistently and predictably, which enhances the readability of code, making it easier for developers to understand and modify code written by others.  As a result, this not only reduces the amount of time and effort required to understand and maintain existing code but also increases the accuracy and reliability of the code.  Maintainability and longevity depend intensely upon coding standards.  Coding standards make modifying and extending code easier as requirements change over time by providing a clear and consistent structure.  Because of this, code is easier to adapt and more likely to prove useful for an extended time.  

However, despite the numerous benefits that coding standards can bring to a software development project, there are also several drawbacks.  One of the main drawbacks is that conforming to a given coding standard may limit creativity and innovation.  In addition, developers may feel constrained by the rules and guidelines of the standard, preventing them from exploring alternative solutions that could be more efficient or effective.  

For example, in the ICS314 class I'm taking, we've been instructed to strictly follow [the Airbnb coding standard.](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/)  While the standard seems reasonable, I prefer to format my code differently.  I'm used to using the [google coding standard for c++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), which seems more natural.

Additionally, adhering to a coding standard may require additional time and effort, slowing the development process and increasing project costs.  I'm used to clang-format, which is as simple as the format-on-save feature.  In IntelliJ IDEA, the process of formatting is instead involved.  Furthermore, coding standards sometimes require clarification.  Some rules may not even be applicable in some instances or may be unclear or confusing.  

This can cause frustration when navigating how to implement a to-standard final product.  In addition, ambiguity can lead to codebase inconsistencies, making it more challenging to maintain and update the software.  Finally, enforcing a coding standard presents an overhead to operational costs, including training and oversight, which may be hard to provide in some organizations, especially those with limited resources.  As such, this can make it challenging for organizations to effectively implement and enforce a coding standard, resulting in a lack of compliance and a codebase that doesn't meet the desired criteria.

Insisting that a piece of code be entirely free of lint errors is perhaps excessively fastidious when those errors consist of minor format variations.  While I fully embrace the concept of adopting universal norms that promote greater compatibility, reliability, and integration of code, enforcing overly bearing standards stifles creativity.  It diverts energy away from producing good code towards ensuring each open parenthesis is preceded by exactly-and-not-to-exceed-one-space.  If such attention to detail is truly necessary, then the formatting tool should do this automatically.  All praise be to format-on-save!

In short, coding standards are crucial for a successful software development project.  They help create a consistent structure and style for the code, making it easier to read, maintain, and scale.  Consequently, this leads to better collaboration and innovation among team members.  However, there are some drawbacks, such as potentially limiting creativity and the extra time and effort spent to adhere to such standards.  Even still, the benefits of having a clear and organized codebase make using coding standards a must for any development team.  By following these standards, organizations can have a more productive and efficient development process.
