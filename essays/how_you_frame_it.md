A user interface (UI) framework is a set of libraries, components, and interfaces that make application development easier (or are supposed to). While much of what can be done with a UI framework can be accomplished with raw HTML and CSS, both frameworks and native HTML have their advantages. Rather than peddle some sensationalist viewpoint of one extreme or the other, I believe that the more tools one has to work with, the better. A good engineer knows which tool to use and for what.

Recently I’ve gotten some hands-on experience messing around with Bootstrap, and some things are neat. I like how modular the elements are and how given enough time, even a novice like me can build great-looking websites. The buttons, menus, icons, and containers make formatting easier than using only raw CSS or HTML. Still there have been times where I found myself reaching for the more straightforward approach. Not because some framework-y solution doesn’t exist, but because my noob skills lack the esoteric knowledge of what combination of bootstrap class recipes accomplish what I want. Formatting multiple columns across a row? Too easy! Making the background of an image translucent and centered on a page? Better give me a couple of hours.

Web development is new to me. It’s weird and non-intuitive, and progress has been slow, but the benefits of being able to create user interfaces would be a massive boon to what I’m currently capable of creating. Bootstrap has been the proverbial dip of the toe in what seems like a bottomless ocean of possibilities, but my experience has left me desiring a different approach. Surely better options exist—tools forged into shape by the hero smithies who have built the internet to its current glory. Surely there exists an editor, somewhere out there, that leverages UI to create UI.

I get it: You have to crawl before you can run, and I’m not overlooking the benefits of being able to troubleshoot or debug a website layout, but I don’t think that substantial projects built only by coding bootstrap, raw HTML, or otherwise is to anyone's advantage. To me, this bottom-up approach is too slow to capture the fleeting nature that creative ideas flow. While bootstrap is a step in the right direction, there still seems to be a steep learning curve for doing anything requiring much precision.
