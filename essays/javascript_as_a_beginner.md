# What is JavaScript?
Javascript (JS) is a widely-used programming language in web development.  As a new programmer, my initial experience with Javascript has been positive.  Before beginning my ICS 314 class that deals primarily with Javascript, I had limited exposure to the language through working with NodeRed.  The syntax is very similar to C++, but it is not a strongly typed language lending to its flexibility in dealing with troves of different types of data-- for better or worse.  For example, suppose a particular use case would benefit from more strict type-checking instead.  In that case, the closely related language of Typescript also exists, which I understand is Javascript, just with types.  

This essay aims to express my thoughts on Javascript thus far, including its strengths and limitations, my personal experience with athletic software engineering, and the practice of daily coding, referred to as WODs.
<br></br>

## Strengths of Javascript
What I like about Javascript is that it's easy to understand, versatile, and has found use across many applications that run the web today.  It is one of the most commonly used programming languages worldwide to create various applications, from basic websites to complex web-based systems.  Most, if not all, modern web browsers support Javascript by default.  As a Javascript developer, there are ample opportunities to find work from real-deal companies such as Google and Meta.  Javascript's syntax is relatively uncomplicated, and it boasts a large, supportive community, making it an approachable language for beginners; it integrates exceptionally well with other languages and tools.  Furthermore, there are so many libraries to leverage a particular application using JS.

My interest in JS stems from what I've read about the Web Of Things (WOT).  As opposed to the Internet-Of-Things (IoT), WoT uses existing web infrastructure and design paradigms, and JS is undoubtedly square within that purview.  Working with NodeRed has given me a glimpse into the potential of how JS can be integrated into projects that could make use of it for many reasons.

## Javascript Pitfalls
If JS is so great, then we should all be using it, right?  Well, maybe not.  While it is an incredibly friendly language, it is less optimized for resource-constrained devices such as those living on any IoT infrastructure's edge.  In addition, it is an interpreted language and thus has a larger footprint than a compiled language such as C, Rust, or even compiled Python.  Another drawback is the execution speed.  The JavaScript Document Object Model is slow (read: sllloooowwww....) compared to languages better suited to real-time applications.

Added to this is the fact that any JS code used within a web application is visible to those using it.  This is arguably true of compiled languages as well through reverse engineering a binary.  Still, I would wager to counter-argue that the energy threshold for dissecting a mountain of assembly code is much steeper than that of peering at neatly stack source code within a browser's inspection pane.

## Javascript's Utility Going into the Future
Despite some of the drawbacks of an otherwise great language, JS still has many things going for it.  It's still a growing and evolving technology with well-thought-out functionality being added, such as the recently adopted ES6 standard, which introduced various features and improvements that improved both code efficiency and readability.  Features such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring indicate that the language is thriving and will likely continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
<br></br>

## Javascript and Software Engineering
From a software engineering perspective, I believe Javascript to be a great programming language, particularly in providing web application features.  It may have drawbacks, but so do all languages in one form or another.  The mark of a sound engineer isn't necessarily contingent on a tool but on knowing which is best suited for a particular task.
<br></br>

## The Value of "WODs"
The ICS 314 class I'm currently taking is pushing the pedagogy of "Athletic Software Engineering" through daily practice problems called "Workouts-Of-The-Day" or WODs.  Thankfully this type of WOD doesn't involve burpees.  Instead, they aim to rapidly increase fluency and skill in a methodology similar to athletic training.  Frequent practice, successively increasing difficulty, and active engagement is more beneficial to acquiring and developing talent than the passive absorption of information typical in the academic setting.  WODs can be challenging, but so long as the difficulty is set optimally, this process is both manageable and enjoyable.
