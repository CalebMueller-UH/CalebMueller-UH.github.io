# Javascript: A Valuable Language for Beginners in Programming
Javascript (JS) is a widely-used programming language in the field of web development. As a new programmer, my initial experience with Javascript has been positive.  Prior to beginning my ICS 314 class that deals primarily with Javascript I had some limited exposure to the language through working with NodeRed.  The syntax is very similar to C++, but it itself is not a strongly typed language lending to its' flexibility in dealing with troves of different types of data-- for better or for worse.  If a particular usecase would rather benefit from more stringent typechecking then the closely related language of Typescript also exists, which from what I understand is Javascript with types.  

This essay aims to express my thoughts on Javascript thus far, including its strengths and limitations, as well as my personal experience with athletic software engineering and the practice of daily coding referred to as "WODs."
<br></br>

## Strengths of Javascript
What I like about Javascript is that it's easy to understand, is versatile, and has found varied use accross many applications that run the web today.  It is one of the most commonly used programming languages worldwide, and is used in the creation of a diverse array of applications, from basic websites to complex web-based systems. Most, if not all modern web browsers, for instance, support Javascript by default.  This means that as a Javascript developer there are ample opportunities to find work from real-deal companies such as Google, and Meta. Javascript's syntax is relatively uncomplicated, and it boasts a large, supportive community, making it an approachable language for beginners; it integrates extremely well with other languages and tools.  Furthermore, there are so many libraries to leverage a particular application using JS.

Personally my interest in JS stems from what I've read about the "Web-Of-Things" (WOT).  As opposed to the "Internet-Of-Things" (IoT), WoT makes use of already existing web infrastucture and design paradigms, and JS is certainly square within that purview.  Working with NodeRed has given me a small glimpse into the potential of how JS can be integrated usefully into projects that could make use of it for any number of reasons.

## Javascripts Pitfalls
If JS is so great then we really should all be using it, right?  Well, maybe not.  While it is an incredibly friendly language to use, it is perhaps less optimized for resource-constrained devices such as those that live on the edge of any IoT infrastructure.  It is an interpreted language, and thus has a larger footprint than that of a compiled language such as C, Rust, or even compiled Python. 

Another drawback is the execution speed.  The JavaScript Document Object Model is slow (read: sllloooowwww....) compared to languages better suited to real-time applications.

Added to this is the fact that any JS code that is used within a web application is visible to those that use it.  You could make the argument that this is also true of compiled languages through reverse engineering, but I would wager to counter-argue that the energy threshold for dissecting a mountain of assembly is much steeper than that of looking at source code neatly stacked within a browsers inspection pane.

## Javascript's Utility Going into the Future
Despite some of the drawbacks of an otherwise great language, JS still has many things going for it.  It's still a growing and evolving technology with well thought-out functionality being added such as the recently adopted ES6 standard.  Unlike some languages where new additions have overcomplicated the syntax, ES6 has introduced various new features and improvements to the language, including arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring that make the development process more efficient, and code more readable.
<br></br>

## Javascript and Software Engineering
From a software engineering perspective, I believe Javascript to be a great programming language, particularly when it comes to providing web-application features.  It may have drawbacks, but so do all languages in one form or another.  I'm of the thought that the mark of a good engineer isn't necessarily contingent on tool, but to know which is best suited for a particular task.
<br></br>

## The Value of "WODs"
The ICS 314 class I'm currently taking is pushing the pedagogy of "Athletic Software Engineering" through daily practice problems called called "Workouts-Of-The-Day" or WOD's.  Thankfully this type of WOD doesn't involve burpees.  Rather their aimed at rapidly increasing fluency and skill in a methodology similar to that of athletic training.  Frequent practice, successively increasing difficulty, and active engagement are more beneficial to the acquiring and development of skill than the passive absorption of information so typical in the academic setting. WODs can be challenging but so long as the difficulty is set optimally this process is both manageable and enjoyable.
